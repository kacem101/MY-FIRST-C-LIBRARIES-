**C Library for Number Strings Arrays Matrices and Ciphers**

This library provides a collection of C functions for working with:

* **Numbers:**
    * Basic arithmetic operations
    * Number comparisons
    * Prime number checks
    * Factorial calculations
    * Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
    * Least Common Multiple (LCM)
* **Strings:**
    * String manipulation functions (e.g., length, concatenation, substring)
    * String comparison 
    * Case conversion (upper/lowercase)
    * String searching and replacement
* **Arrays:**
    * Array creation, initialization
    * Array sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort)
    * Array searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
    * Array manipulation functions (e.g., finding minimum/maximum, reversing)
* **Matrices:**
    * Matrix creation, initialization, and resizing
    * Matrix operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication)
    * Matrix transposition
    * Determinant calculation
    * Checking Matrix Properties
* **Ciphers:**
    * Caesar cipher encryption/decryption
    * Vigen√®re cipher encryption/decryption
    * Simple substitution cipher encryption/decryption
    * Rail fence cipher
    * Vigenere cipher
* **Usage/Link to your application:**
